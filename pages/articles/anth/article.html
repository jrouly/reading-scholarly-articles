    <h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
Educational reformers and social observers call for increasing community in
our schools and neighborhoods. In that discourse, community appears as a
catch phrase that has become meaningless in its ubiquity. Through an
ethnographic study of a small elementary school in which community is
regularly invoked, the author identifies community's negative as well as
beneficial aspects and discusses the implications for schools.
