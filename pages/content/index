      Along the left is a series of available research fields. Each

        <h3 class="popover-title">Article Title</h3>
        <div class="popover-content">
          <p>No article is complete without a title! Make sure to
          title your articles something intersting yet
          descriptive. You want your audience to be both
          interested <em>and</em> informed.</p>
