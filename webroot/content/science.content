Marked impacts of climate change on biodiversity have frequently been
demonstrated, including temperature-related shifts in phenology and
life-history traits. One potential major impact of climate change is the
modification of synchronization between the phenology of different trophic
levels. High phenotypic plasticity in laying date has allowed many bird species
to track the increasingly early springs resulting from recent environmental
change, but although changes in the timing of reproduction have been well
studied in birds, these questions have only recently been addressed in mammals.
To track peak resource availability, large herbivores like roe deer, with a
widespread distribution across Europe, should also modify their life-history
schedule in response to changes in vegetation phenology over time. In this
study, we analysed the influence of climate change on the timing of roe deer
births and the consequences for population demography and individual fitness.
Our study provides a rare quantification of the demographic costs associated
with the failure of a species to modify its phenology in response to a changing
world. Given these fitness costs, the lack of response of roe deer birth dates
to match the increasingly earlier onset of spring is in stark contrast with the
marked phenotypic responses to climate change reported in many other mammals.
We suggest that the lack of phenotypic plasticity in birth timing in roe deer
is linked to its inability to track environmental cues of variation in resource
availability for the timing of parturition.
