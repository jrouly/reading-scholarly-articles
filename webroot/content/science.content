              <div class="col-sm-12"> Marked impacts of climate change on
biodiversity have frequently been demonstrated, including temperature-related
shifts in phenology and life-history traits. One potential major impact of
climate change is the modification of synchronization between the phenology of
different trophic levels. High phenotypic plasticity in laying date has allowed
many bird species to track the increasingly early springs resulting from recent
environmental change, but although changes in the timing of reproduction have
been well studied in birds, these questions have only recently been addressed
in mammals.  To track peak resource availability, large herbivores like roe
deer, with a widespread distribution across Europe, should also modify their
life-history schedule in response to changes in vegetation phenology over time.
In this study, we analysed the influence of climate change on the timing of roe
deer births and the consequences for population demography and individual
fitness.  Our study provides a rare quantification of the demographic costs
associated with the failure of a species to modify its phenology in response to
a changing world. Given these fitness costs, the lack of response of roe deer
birth dates to match the increasingly earlier onset of spring is in stark
contrast with the marked phenotypic responses to climate change reported in
many other mammals.  We suggest that the lack of phenotypic plasticity in birth
timing in roe deer is linked to its inability to track environmental cues of
variation in resource availability for the timing of parturition.  </p> </div>

Marked impacts of climate change on biodiversity have frequently been
demonstrated, including temperature-related shifts in phenology and
life-history traits [1]. Species living at high altitudes or latitudes are
particularly affected by climate change [2,3], but widespread species
inhabiting temperate areas are also responding [4]. Global temperatures have
risen by 0.89uC since 1901 [5], and this has led to an advance in the timing of
key life- history events by, on average, 2.8 d per decade [6]. Earlier springs
have caused phenological modifications in most taxonomic groups [1,7]. The
phenology of vegetation, particularly trees, has advanced with time (by 3.3 d
per decade [6]). A failure of species to track these changes may have important
demographic consequences that, in turn, could impact conservation and
management issues. Changes in the timing of reproduction have been well studied
in birds [8–10], but have only recently been considered in mammals [3,4,11].
These studies suggest that a change in the timing of peak resource availability
typically generates a change in median laying or breeding date [9,12,13]. This
response ensures that individuals can synchronize their energetic demands for
offspring production and provisioning [14] with the period when environmental
conditions are the most favorable [15].
                </p>

                <p>
A key question about the consequences of global change is which species can
respond and how [16]. Although most studied species have responded to match
resource availability with energy requirements, the response is not always
exact or immediate [17,18]. Phenotypic plasticity may play a major role in the
adjustment of reproductive timing to earlier springs [19]. In a population of
great tits, those individuals that could vary their reproductive timing the
most had higher fitness [20]. But for individuals to shift their reproductive
cycle in order to track environmental modifications, they require a reliable
environmental cue [21,22]. The timing of breeding is influenced by photoperiod
in many species of birds and mammals [23–25], a cue that is clearly unaffected
by climate change. Nonetheless, some species, including the great tit and red
deer, rely on temperature [26,27] to minimize the mismatch between birth timing
and the peak resource availability. If earlier breeding increases fitness,
selection could also drive a micro-evolutionary change in terms of advanced
reproductive timing [8] as long as birth date is heritable.
                </p>

                <p>
The relative role of phenotypic plasticity and micro-evolutionary change
remains largely unquantified [28], although R&eacute;ale et al. [4] showed that
the advance in birth timing in red squirrel was mostly due to phenotypic
plasticity rather than micro-evolution. Although some species have advanced

                <p>
their birth timing in response to increasing temperature, some species have not
[29] whereas others have delayed their reproductive phenology [1]. For
instance, Columbian ground squirrels have delayed their breeding phenology by
0.47 d per year over a period of 20 y, leading to a reduction in fitness by a
half between 1993 and 2003 [3]. On the other hand, birth timing in caribou
advanced at a much slower rate than the vegetation flush over a period of 33
years, so that the mismatch between birth timing and peak resource availability
increased, causing calf production to decline [30,31].
                </p>

                <p>
Births are highly seasonal and synchronous in most large herbivores [32],
including roe deer [33,34], in which more than 90% occur within 1 mo [35]. Roe
deer females are income breeders and selectively feed on highly digestible and
nutritious young shoots, especially during early lactation when energetic
demand peaks [14]. Synchrony between births and the peak availability of
high-quality vegetation is expected to be crucial for successful recruitment.
The reproductive cycle of roe deer is unique among ungulates, including a phase
of embryonic diapause that appears not to vary in duration among females [36].
As in reindeer where reproductive timing may be driven by day length [37], both
ovulation and conception dates appear to be under the control of photoperiod
[38], which could explain the lack of variation in parturition date across
years for a given female [33,35].
                </p>

                <p>
Focusing on the mismatch between birth date and plant phenology, we investigate
how climate change is currently affecting roe deer fitness. Our study on the
intensively monitored roe deer population at Trois Fontaines, eastern France,
spans 27 y, from 1985 to 2011. We tested the three following predictions: (i)
As most mammals studied so far have shown a response to climate change, we
expected that roe deer births should occur earlier in response to the advance
in vegetation phenology. (ii) Because parturition date varies little across
years for a given roe deer female [35], indicating limited phenotypic
plasticity, but because it has been shown to be heritable in mammals [39,40],
and markedly influences early offspring survival [40], we expected any change
in birth timing to be mainly the result of natural selection. And (iii) because
such micro-evolutionary responses are often delayed, we expected that despite
any advance in birth timing, the mismatch between peak energetic demand and
peak resource availability should likely increase over time, leading to
negative impacts on roe deer performance. Our study provides a unique
quantification, to our knowledge, of the demographic costs associated with the
failure of a species to modify its phenology in response to a warming world.

Analysis of local weather variables revealed a strong local impact of climate
change that translated into increasingly earlier and warmer springs over time.
Annual spring (April to June) temperature increased by 0.07&deg;C per year
(<em>SE</em> = 0.02, <em>p</em> = 0.001, Figure 1) at Trois Fontaines over the
study period. Analysis of flowering date in the vineyards of the Champagne
region indicated that annual timing of plant phenology in the region had
advanced by 0.6 d per year (<em>SE</em> = 0.18, <em>p</em> = 0.002, Figure 1)
over this period, so that the peak in availability of high-quality resources
for roe deer was increasingly early from 1985 to 2011. Spring mean temperature
and flowering date in the Champagne region were negatively correlated over this
period (<em>p</em> = -0.89, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). We therefore used flowering
date as a proxy of the vegetation flush and compared it to annual variation in
the timing of roe deer births. Roe deer give birth about 1 mo before the onset
of flowering in Champagne because they preferentially feed on leaves and young
shoots that become available before flowering. The mismatch between median
birth date and vegetation phenology was estimated from the difference between
median birth date and annual flowering date in the Champagne vineyards. We
standardized this measure (by subtracting the observed value of mismatch in the
first year (1985) from this variable) to obtain a relative measure of mismatch
ranging from 0 in 1985 to 36 d in 2011.

                <p>
In contradiction with our first prediction, annual median birth date did not
occur earlier over time. Both the mean and median birth dates of roe deer at
Trois Fontaines remained remarkably stable among years (based on 1,095 birth
dates, <em>mean</em> = 136.1, <em>SE</em> = 8.56; time trend, <em>t</em> =
-0.82, <em>p</em> = 0.421; and median = 136, the 16th of May, <em>t</em> =
21.23, <em>p</em> = 0.232 for mean and median birth dates, respectively, Figure
S4A). Neither the spring mean temperature nor flowering date in the Champagne
region had a detectable influence on median birth date (Pearson’s product
moment, <em>r</em> = 20.07, <em>p</em> = 0.730 and <em>r</em> = 0.11,
<em>p</em> = 0.575 for spring mean temperature and flowering date,
respectively). Consequently, the mismatch between median birth date and
vegetation phenology increased by 0.54 d per year (<em>SE</em> = 0.20,
<em>p</em> = 0.011, Figure 1) between 1985 and 2011. We did not find any
correlation between median birth date and other environmental drivers (Table
S1), suggesting that roe deer females are unable to track these potential
environmental cues.

We investigated whether birth date of roe deer fulfilled the three necessary
conditions for evolutionary change to occur: variability, heritability, and a
selection pressure [41]. First, variation in parturition date among roe deer
females has been recently quantified and found to be consistently high within
several populations [35], with long-lived and/or heavier females (i.e.,
high-quality individuals) giving birth earlier than low-quality females [42].
Second, we found no strong statistical support for heritability in parturition
date when estimated from the parent– offspring relationship based on 28
daughter–mother pairs (b = 0.234, SE = 0.13, p = 0.094, h 2 = 0.127). Third, we
identified directional selection favoring early births, with a strong negative
relationship between individual birth date and individual early survival from
May 12th onwards (on a logit scale b = 20.06, SE = 0.01, p,0.001, Figure S1).
                </p>

                <p>
Note that year was included as a categorical variable in this model to control
for interannual variation in environmental conditions affecting early survival.
A model including a threshold effect of individual birth date on individual
early survival provided a better fit than a linear (DAIC = 6.12) or a quadratic
(DAIC = 0.50) model. Thus, a fawn born before May 12th had, on average, a 50%
chance of surviving to 8 mo of age, whereas a fawn born on May 31st had, on
average, only a 24% chance of surviving to that age. Adding a term describing
interactive effects between birth date and year did not improve the fit of the
model (DAIC = 9.28), indicating that the response of individual early survival
to individual birth date was consistent across cohorts. Taken together these
results suggest that we should not expect a strong micro-evolutionary response
of parturition date in roe deer.

t the population level, cohort-specific survival (measured as the proportion of
fawns that survived to the onset of winter each year) was negatively correlated
with our index of mismatch (arcsine- square root transformation: b = 20.009, SE
= 0.003, p = 0.012).  Adding a quadratic term (DAIC = 1.95) or a threshold
effect (DAIC = 1.86) of mismatch did not improve model fit. Early
cohort-specific survival of juveniles decreased by 40% with an increase in
mismatch of 1 mo (Figure 2).
                </p>

                <p>
At the individual level, the mismatch was a better predictor of early survival
(R 2 = 0.037) than birth date (R 2 = 0.025) (DAIC = 8.90, Table S2; note that
year was not included in these models because interannual variation was
integrated within the mismatch variable). Individual early survival was
constant when the mismatch was 16 d or less, but then decreased linearly beyond
16 d of mismatch (Table S2, Figure 3). When birth occurred at least 1 mo (35 d)
before flowering date in Champagne’s vineyards, a fawn had an expected
probability of 0.5 of surviving to 8 mo of age, whereas this probability was
only 0.25 when birth occurred 2 wk prior to flowering (Figure 3).
                </p>

                <p>
We built an IPM describing the temporal dynamics of parturition date in our roe
deer population to quantify the impact of this increasing mismatch on roe deer
fitness. The distribution of parturition date in the population at time t+1
depends on the distribution of parturition date at time t and on the four
relationships linking parturition date with survival, recruitment, transition
between two successive parturition events, and inheritance of parturition date
between mother and offspring (see Text S1, Tables S2, S3, S4, and Figure S2 for
further details [43,44]).  Annual flowering date in the vineyards of the
Champagne region was included in the IPM to model the local shift in plant
phenology. As most roe deer females give birth to two fawns [45] and the sex
ratio is close to 0.5 at birth at Trois Fontaines [46], the recruitment
function linking the number of female offspring a mother has successfully
weaned given its parturition date was modeled by individual early survival
(Table S5, Figure 3).
                </p>

              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-6">

                <p>
The IPM predicted mean parturition date to occur on the 17th of May each year,
with a very slight, but statistically significant, advance of just 0.27 d over
the whole 27-y study period (b = 2 0.010, SE = 0.003, p = 0.006, Figure S4B).
The model also predicted earlier parturition as females aged, with 2-y-old
females giving birth, on average, 5 d later than older females (Figure S5).
The estimated population growth rate, and so the mean fitness of females in the
population, decreased by 6% on average over the study period (b = 20.003, SE =
0.001, p = 0.008, Figure 1), from 1.23 in 1985 to 1.06 in 2011. Marked
variability in environmental conditions between successive years often leads to
a decrease in the arithmetic mean population growth rate [47]. Consequently, we
estimated the geometric mean of population growth rate for successive periods
of 4 y. The geometric mean population growth rate also decreased over the study
period (b = 20.009, SE = 0.002, p = 0.002). Thus, the IPM allowed us to
demonstrate a clear impact of the mismatch between energy demand and peak
resource availability on mean fitness, which declined in this population of roe
deer over the entire study period. In accordance with these results, we also
observed a decrease in mean annual female reproductive success over the study
period (b = 20.027, SE = 0.005, p,0.001; note that these data are independent
of those used to build the IPM, see Figure S3).

This study has demonstrated that mean fitness is currently decreasing in this
roe deer population due to the lack of response in parturition date to the
increasingly early availability of high- quality resources induced by climate
change. Warming at Trois Fontaines over the last 27 y (0.46&deg;C per decade)
was more than threefold greater than the average global expectation from the
2013 IPCC report on climate change (0.12 [0.08–0.14] per decade since 1951,
[5]). This local warming has led to an advance in spring plant phenology [48]
demonstrated by the advance in flowering date in Champagne’s vineyards. In
contrast to most other studied mammals that have been able to track resource
availability by advancing their birth timing [3,4,13,49], the median birth date
of roe deer remained constant over years. This generated an increased mismatch
between mean birth date and phenology of the vegetation such that at the end of
the study period fawns were born relatively later with respect to the peak in
availability of high quality resources. Post and Forchhammer [30] were the
first to describe a negative impact of a mismatch between resource availability
and birth timing on calf production in Greenland caribou. In our study, climate
change over recent decades has had a similarly negative impact on early
survival (i.e., a ‘‘climatic debt’’ [16]), both at the individual and at the
population levels. Furthermore, we were able to show that this mismatch between
parturition and the availability of highly digestible forage led to a decline
in mean fitness of 6% over the study period, and of 14% between 1985 and those
years when the vegetation flush was particularly early (2007 and 2011). This
link between plant phenology and roe deer population dynamics, mostly driven
through recruitment, is the likely mechanism for the observed decrease in
population growth rate over time [50].
                </p>

                <p>
Our study provides an illustration of the probable fitness costs for species
which do not respond to climate change. Indeed, the increasing mismatch between
the peak of roe deer births and the onset of the vegetation flush in recent
years had a negative impact on both early survival and mean fitness. Previous
studies have reported an impact of climate change on recruitment [30,51,52].
However, the influence of mismatch on fitness and population dynamics has
received much less attention. IPMs allow the phenotypic consequences of climate
change to be explored (see also [49]), which is not possible using classical
statistical methods. In contrast to a recent study on birds [53], we found that
population growth rate of roe deer was not buffered against phenological
mismatch. Mean fitness was most strongly affected during years when plant
phenology was particularly early, for example, in 2007 and 2011 (l = 1.07
versus l = 1.23 for the first year of the study). We can therefore predict that
this increasing mismatch will further increase the energetic costs of breeding
for females [54] as spring phenology continues to advance in the future.
                </p>

                <p>
The lack of response in roe deer birth date to climate change provides a stark
contrast with the previous findings on most mammalian species studied to date,
which have shown phenotypic responses to climate change [3,4,13,49]. Despite
the clear selection pressure that we demonstrated, which should favor earlier
births over time, we showed that a strong evolutionary change is not expected
in roe deer. Indeed, we found no strong statistical support for heritability of
birth date, despite the fact that parent–offspring regressions are known to
overestimate heritabilities [55]. However, as the number of mother–daughter
pairs (N = 28) available to assess heritability of birth date was low, further
work on a much larger sample size is required to explore this question.
Nonetheless, both the classical statistical approach and the IPM provided
similar results and clearly indicated no change in roe deer reproductive
timing. Although roe deer did not exhibit an evolutionary response to climate
change, why have they not responded plastically [4,20]?

                <p>
Roe deer females appear unable to track environmental cues such as temperature
to time their birth event. Birth timing in mammals is mainly driven by the date
of conception and gestation length.  Ovulation and, thereby, conception date is
mainly under the control of photoperiod in roe deer [38]. Gestation begins with
a phase of embryonic diapause that probably originally evolved to increase
gestation length [56], but we expected this historical selection pressure for
delayed birth to be counterbalanced by selection for earlier birth date in
response to climate change over recent times.  However, diapause appears to be
triggered by an intrinsic mechanism involving the mother or even the embryo
itself, and the 5-mo duration appears not to vary among females [36]. In many
species, adaptive phenotypic plasticity has generated a response to changes in
phenology (great tit [57], red squirrel [4]). In red deer, a species related to
roe deer that is able to track earlier plant phenology [13], gestation length
decreased with increasing average temperature in March [58]. In contrast, in
roe deer, we have shown that parturition timing is independent of changes in
temperature and in the onset of the vegetation flush, suggesting this lack of
phenotypic plasticity in birth timing is associated with an inability to track
environmental cues of variation in resource availability for the timing of
parturition.
                </p>

                <p>
Earlier plant phenology is likely the main cause of the observed decrease in
early survival, and thereby in mean fitness, in this roe deer population.
Although the roe deer population consistently displayed positive growth over
the 27-y study period (i.e., l consistently higher than 1), population growth
rate (and therefore average individual fitness) decreased in a continuous
fashion by 6% over this period. Moreover, temperatures are expected to increase
further in the future, causing the phenology of vegetation to advance still
further. We suggest that these combined effects could impose a brake on the
demographic and geographical expansion of roe deer, a common and previously
successful species across all Europe [59].

Trois Fontaines (48&deg;43N, 2&deg;61W) is an enclosed 1,360 ha forest located
near Saint-Dizier, at the border of Marne and Haute-Marne counties in
north-eastern France. In spring (from mid-March to mid-June), the number of
rainy days averaged 31.5 (ranging between 18 and 52 d during the study period
1985–2011) and the temperature averaged

10.4uC (ranging between 26.06&deg;C and
15.00&deg;C). The forest is dominated by oak (<em>Quercus sp.</em>) and beech
(<em>Fagus sylvatica</em>). Roe deer feed mainly on coppice and the understory
is dominated by hornbeam (<em>Carpinus betulus</em>), ivy (<em>Hedera

The roe deer population at Trois Fontaines has been intensively monitored for
more than 35 y by the Office National de la Chasse et de la Faune Sauvage based
on a detailed Capture-Mark- Recapture program. Roe deer are individually marked
using numbered collars and ear-tags. A systematic search for newborn fawns was
conducted every year from late April to mid-June between 1985 and 2010 [60]. In
2011, searches ended earlier and the last fawn was found on May 20th. Fawns
were handled by experienced people, ear-tagged, and weighed. Their sex was
recorded and their age estimated to the nearest day using umbilicus
characteristics and behaviour at marking [61]. Birth dates were back-calculated
using these estimated ages and the day of capture. The average age at marking
was about 5 d, and all fawns were marked within 20 d.

              <div class="col-sm-6">

                <p>
The identity of the mother for a given fawn was established, when possible,
through direct observations of lactating behavior or by the identification of
an escaping female in the vicinity of the fawn. From January to March, annual
capture sessions took place, with capture of more than 50% of the roe deer
population each year, providing reliable information on the fate of animals
marked at birth. Individual early survival was defined as the probability of
survival of a fawn from birth to the next winter (see [62] for further
details). At Trois Fontaines, fawn mortality was most likely associated with
shortage of high-quality food because this population is not subject to marked
predation or hunting pressure. At the population level, mean cohort-specific
early survival was estimated using Capture- Recapture analyses [63] from 1985
to 2011.  Cohort-specific early survival could not be estimated with accuracy
for 2012 (see [62]), so these data were not included here. Data are available
from Table S6.

The local daily temperature was collected from the M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France
weather station of Saint-Dizier located at less than 5 km from the study site.
Spring temperature (April to June) was used to assess the magnitude of climate
warming at the local scale. To measure annual changes in vegetation phenology,
we used the mean flowering date of vineyards in the Champagne region collected
by the Comit&eacute; Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne and available on
the website of the French Observatoire National sur les Effets du
R&eacute;chauffement Climatique (<a
href="http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/-Impacts-et-adaptation-ONERC-.html">http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/-Impacts-et-adaptation-ONERC-.html</a>).
Flowering date is little influenced by human activity and reliably reflects the
phenology of the vegetation of that year. Moreover, flowering date in Champagne
is highly correlated with the local sum of degree-days (r = 20.61, p,0.001),
which is often used to index vegetation growth [13,64], with spring temperature
(r = 20.83, p,0.001) and with annual mean temperature (r = 20.57, p,0.001). As
a consequence, flowering date in Champagne reliably indexes the overall changes
in plant phenology over years.

              <div class="col-sm-6">

                <p>
When flowering date in Champagne was early in
the year, we assumed that the availability of high-quality resources for roe
deer provided by spring vegetation was also early.  Consequently, we used the
difference between birth date and flowering date in Champagne as a measure of
the mismatch between birth date and peak resource availability.
                </p>

                <p>
To assess temporal trends in local temperature, vegetation phenology, and birth
date, we fitted linear regressions with a Gaussian error. Subsequently, we
examined the relationships of cohort-specific median birth date with mean
spring temperature and with flowering date in Champagne to test whether birth
date tracked climate change. To quantify the mismatch between median birth date
and the vegetation flush at the population level, we subtracted the median
birth date from the annual flowering date.

Available data were not detailed enough to build pedigrees, so we measured
heritability using the weighted regression of the median parturition date of
each daughter against the median parturition date of her mother [65]. To assess
whether roe deer birth date was under selection, we analyzed the relationship
between birth date and early survival

at the level of the individual with a generalized linear model and a logit
link. We included year in the model to control for interannual variation in
environmental conditions. We tested for linear, quadratic, and threshold
effects of birth date on individual early survival. Finally, we tested for an
interaction between birth date and year to investigate whether the selection
pressure was similar over time.

To assess whether roe deer exhibited a phenotypic response to climate change,
both at the population and individual levels, we used mean cohort-specific
early survival after an arcsine-square root transformation; we investigated the
relationships between cohort-specific early survival and the mismatch, testing
for linear, quadratic, and threshold effects of the mismatch. Each point of the
regression was weighted (using the inverse of the variance of cohort-specific
early survival) to account for uncertainty in the estimates of cohort-specific
survival. Then, we investigated whether the mismatch was a better predictor of
early survival than birth date at the individual level. We did not include year
in this model as among-year variations were integrated within the mismatch
variable. We tested for linear, quadratic, and threshold effects of birth date
or the birth date–vegetation phenology mismatch on individual early survival
with a generalized linear model and a logit link. We compared the relative fit
of the different models using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).

To investigate the influence of plant phenology on mean fitness, we built an
Integral Projection Model (IPM, [43,44]) describing the dynamics of parturition
date in the population. Selection and estimations for the models describing the
four functions defining the IPM (survival, recruitment, transition, and
inheritance) are detailed in the Supporting Information section. This IPM
allowed us to investigate the influence of the timing of peak resource
availability on the outputs of the model: the annual asymptotic population
growth rate, in other words, annual mean fitness over the study period. As
previous studies in this population have revealed no effect of density
dependence on any of the demographic parameters, we did not include density in
our demographic analysis (supplementary material of [50]).
